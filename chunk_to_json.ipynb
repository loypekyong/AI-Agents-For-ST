customers . The reduction in borrowings (current) was due to repayment as well as \\nrefinancing of short -term borrowings via the Group’s issuance of US$500 million of medium -term notes, \\nwhich corres pondingly increased borrowings (non -current).   \\n \\nNotwithstanding the Group’s net current liabilities position of $1 ,291 million  as at 30 June 2023, it has \\navailable financial resources to meet its obligations as and when they fall due. To ensure that the G roup \\nis not exposed to short -term liquidity risk, its outstanding U nited States C ommercial Papers (USCP) of \\n$2.0 billion are backstopped by a committed revolving credit facility (RCF) of $ 2.1 billion.  The RCF \\nremains undrawn as at 30 June 2023 and is more than enough to refinance all the outstanding USCP, \\nif needed, and to cover the Group’s net current liabilities position. The Group has very strong credit \\nratings (Aaa by Moody’s and AA+ by Standard & Poor's) which provide it ready access to additional \\nborrowings as necessary.   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 8 of 26 \\n \", 'document_title': 'CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST HALF -YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023', 'document_summary': \"This document is about: the condensed interim financial statements of Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd for the first half-year ended 30 June 2023, detailing the company's financial performance, position, and cash flows.\"}, {'kb_id': 'st_eng_1h2023', 'doc_id': 'st-engineering-1h2023-financial-statement', 'section_title': 'Borrowings Overview', 'section_summary': '', 'chunk_text': \"                                                               3(b) BORROWINGS  \\n \\n30-Jun-23 31-Dec-22 30-Jun-23 31-Dec-22\\n$'000 $'000 $'000 $'000\\nAmount repayable within one year\\nSecured 98,991       80,572       113             114            \\nUnsecured 2,510,932  3,547,397  -               -              \\n2,609,923  3,627,969  113             114            \\nAmount repayable after one year\\nSecured 507,451     545,012     -               -              \\nUnsecured 3,051,029  2,361,556  -               -              \\n3,558,480  2,906,568  -               -              \\nTotal 6,168,403  6,534,537  113             114            GROUP COMPANY\\n \\n \", 'document_title': 'CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST HALF -YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023', 'document_summary': \"This document is about: the condensed interim financial statements of Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd for the first half-year ended 30 June 2023, detailing the company's financial performance, position, and cash flows.\"}, {'kb_id': 'st_eng_1h2023', 'doc_id': 'st-engineering-1h2023-financial-statement', 'section_title': 'Overview of Financial Assets and Liabilities', 'section_summary': '', 'chunk_text': \"3(c) FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  \\n \\nSet out below is an overview of the financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group as at 30 June \\n2023 and 3 1 December 2022: \\n \\n30-Jun-23 31-Dec-22\\n$'000 $'000\\nFinancial assets\\nInvestments 59,831        76,704       \\nAssociates 15,531        15,460       \\nDerivative financial instruments 62,333        50,359       \\nTrade receivables 1,213,134   1,163,491  \\nAmounts due from related parties 71,505        170,089     \\nAdvances and other receivables 152,100      147,577     \\nBank balances and other liquid funds 387,150      601,771     \\n1,961,584   2,225,451  \\nFinancial liabilities\\nDerivative financial instruments 33,250        57,423       \\nTrade payables and accruals 2,825,709   2,899,210  \\nAmounts due to related parties 35,344        41,887       \\nBorrowings 6,168,403   6,534,537  \\n9,062,706   9,533,057  GROUP\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 9 of 26 \\n \\n                                                                \", 'document_title': 'CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FIRST HALF -YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023', 'document_summary': \"This document is about: the condensed interim financial statements of Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd for the first half-year ended 30 June 2023, detailing the company's financial performance, position, and cash flows.\"}, {'kb_id': 'st_eng_1h2023', 'doc_id': 'st-engineering-1h2023-financial-statement', 'section_title': 'Fair Value Hierarchy and Measurement Techniques', 'section_summary': '', 'chunk_text': '3(d) FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  \\n \\nThe Group classifies fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance \\nof the inputs used in making the measurements.
