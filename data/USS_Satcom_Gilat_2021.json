Theses sanctions and restrictions may materially restrict the Company\u2019s business in Russia which mainly includes exports to Russia, which amounted to approximately $6,300 in 2021, and may delay or prevent the Company from collecting funds and perform money transfers from Russia. While the Company\u2019s business in Russia is of limited in scope and not material to the Company\u2019s consolidated results, these restrictions may cause a reduction of the Company\u2019s sales and financial results. In Addition, The Company receives manufacturing services from a global manufacturer\u2019s facility in Ukraine. While the manufacturer assured the Company that the operations of the plant have not been interrupted by the military situation in Ukraine and has a recovery plan in place, there is no assurance that negative developments in the area in the future will not disrupt the Company\u2019s business and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. \nF -67 ", "document_title": "ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 20-F FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2021", "document_summary": "This document is about: the annual financial performance and operational overview of Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, including risk factors, business segments, and management's discussion of results."}]}
